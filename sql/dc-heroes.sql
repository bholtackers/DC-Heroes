Early Life      Main article: Batman Origins  Bruce Wayne was born to the wealthy doctor Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, who were themselves members of the prestigious Wayne and Kane families of Gotham City, respectively.  When he was very young, Bruce\'s mother Martha was expecting a second child to be named Thomas Wayne, Jr. However, because of her intent to found a school for the underprivileged in Gotham, she was targeted by the manipulative Court of Owls, who arranged for her to get into a car accident. She and Bruce survived, but the accident forced Martha into premature labour, and the baby was lost.[2] While on vacation to forget about these events, the Wayne Family butler, Jarvis Pennyworth was killed by one of the Court of Owls\' Talons. A letter he\'d written to his son Alfred, warning him away from the beleaguered Wayne family, was never delivered. As such, Alfred - who had been an actor at the Globe Theatre at the time[3] and a military medic before that, travelled to Gotham City to take up his father\'s place, serving the Waynes as butler.[4] The Waynes&#039; murder.  The Waynes\' murder. As he grew older, his family\'s reputation made Bruce restless, and he began sneaking out of school to visit Gotham City, where he wouldn\'t be so easily recognized.[5] On one such outing, he was picked up by Officer Jim Gordon and his partner on their patrol. En route back to the station, Bruce witnessed Jim accepting a trenchcoat as a bribe from a tailor - though neither realized it was a bribe at the time - but Bruce would remember it as an indicator of Jim\'s character. After his parents came to retrieve him, the Waynes went to see The Mark of Zorro at the Monarch Theater. After the film, a mugger named Joe Chill attempted to rob them at gunpoint, and panicked, shooting both Thomas and Martha dead.[6]'),

After Jor-El discovered that the planet was doomed to destruction, he attempted to escape with his family into the Phantom Zone but was repelled by the criminals who had been imprisoned there. With no other choice, he and Lara resigned themselves to their fates, placing their son in a prototype evacuation rocket, activating its Brainiac intelligence, and sending it to a place with a yellow sun: Earth.[1]  The crash site was discovered by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who had just learned that they could not have children. Seeing this alien orphan as their chance, they gathered him up and took him home, leaving a stillborn calf in his place in the hopes of throwing the government off their trail.[2] They raised him as Clark Kent in Smallville, Kansas, teaching him their values. Eventually, Jonathan revealed Clark\'s true parentage to him, but left it to him to decide what it would mean. On the night of his prom, however, Clark\'s adopted parents were both killed in a car accident.[3] After their funerals, Clark sold Kent Farm to a neighbour and moved to Metropolis to become a journalist.[4] '),

Early Life  Arthur Curry was born the son of the Atlantean queen Atlanna and the Amnesty Bay lighthouse keeper Tom Curry. Atlanna returned to Atlantis, so Tom was forced to raise Arthur alone. As a child Arthur began to show that he had inherited his mother\'s gifts. Tom turned to Doctor Stephen Shin, a scientist he saved from a storm, so he could better understand Arthur\'s abilities.  During the time of Arthur\'s graduation Shin attempted to release his research to the public, so Tom destroyed all of it except a phial of Arthur\'s blood which he took. Shin paid a treasure hunter known as the Black Manta to retrieve the phial from the Curry household. However there was a struggle and the stress caused Tom to suffer a heart attack, and he died in the hospital soon after. Arthur then tracked Black Manta down and killed his father, believing it to be Manta himself.[2] He then fled civilization until he was brought to Atlantis by his mother\'s royal adviser Vulko.[3]  He ruled over Atlantis for a while until he fled his role and his brother Orm took the throne. He went on to form The Others, a team made up of outcasts who would search the globe for the Dead King\'s Atlantean Weapons so they could be save guarded. After retrieving the artifacts and keeping the Trident of Neptune, Aquaman parted ways with the Others.[4]  At some point between leaving the Others and joining the Justice League, Arthur met and fell in love with Mera, a Xebelian princess sent to kill him.[5] '),

These included a Promethean skin graft, Dr. Will Magnus\' Responsometer, Professor Ivo\'s A-maze operating system, the classified and prototypical B-maze operating system, and Dr. Ryan Choi\'s White Dwarf Stabilizer, as well as the energies from the Father Box. This allowed Vic to access the vast New Gods data library and discover Darkseid\'s true invasion plans.[3]  When Vic first woke up after the accident, he discovered he could not move his legs, and then later learned of his new robotic body. The Red Room was attacked by a group of Parademons; before they could hurt Dr. Charles, Cyborg\'s defense system\'s reacted automatically, causing his arm to shift into a sonic cannon. He destroyed the creatures, along with half the building. Vic, still in shock, asked his father what happened to him; his father told him that he couldn\'t let him die. Vic escaped through the hole in the wall, with his father\'s calls to stay falling on deaf ears.  While roaming the streets, Vic saved a woman being attacked by Parademons; in the process, he also absorbed some of the Parademon\'s components, giving him access to Boom Tube technology. This new ability automatically transported him to the site of a major battle, where he met Aquaman, Batman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Superman and Wonder Woman while trying to control his new powers.[4] In the middle of the alien invasion, he helped them fight Darkseid and his Parademon army.[5] Cyborg tapped into the alien technology to close their portal after Superman hurled Darkseid back to Apokolips.

He received the divorce papers on the day of the spelling bee, and because Nora had to work, he seethed and took Barry to school. When Nora returned from work, she was happy to see that her son had won the competition, but she was obligated to speak to Henry about their relationship, and so Barry was sent to the bookstore in the meantime. By the time Barry returned, his mother had been murdered, and his father had been placed under arrest, though he professed his innocence.  Fortunately, Darryl Frye, who had secretly been involved romantically with Nora, pulled some strings and was able to take Barry in. Having learned from Darryl that the search for evidence, in that case, would inevitably lead to the truth, Barry became a forensic scientist. For years, he visited Henry in prison, promising to look over all of the evidence of his mother\'s murder case until he found a way to prove his father\'s innocence. After years of coming back, and failing to find any proof, Henry broke down and admitted that he had committed the crime. The shock of realizing that all of his efforts had been for nothing depressed Barry. On the night of a storm, Barry angrily tore his lab apart. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning crashed through his lab\'s window, and struck him in the chest, causing him to drop the chemical vials he was carrying, and douse himself.

Origin  Jessica Cruz went on a hunting trip with her friends and unfortunately came across mobsters who were burying a body. Unwilling to have witnesses, the mobsters shot and killed Jessica\'s friends while Jessica herself managed to escape, but was extremely traumatized by the incident. Jessica developed debilitating anxiety and locked herself in her room for 4 years.[1][2] During the Crime Syndicate\'s rule, she was unwillingly chosen by the Ring of Volthoom, after its former bearer, Harold Jordan of Earth 3, was killed by Sinestro. Unlike the ring\'s predecessors, the ring forced itself upon Jessica and took over her body. Under the influence of the ring, she attacked her home town and was confronted by the Justice League and Doom Patrol. Through the intervention of Batman, Jessica was able to overcome the ring\'s influence when he told her that he was a victim like her and that finding strength, even at their worst moment of despair, will overcome their fears.[2]  Allying herself with the Justice League, the Flash called in Hal Jordan, Earth\'s first Green Lantern, to teach Jessica how to stay in control of her ring. With Hal\'s help, Jessica mastered the use of the foreign ring. Darkseid War  When Darkseid\'s daughter Grail arrived on Earth, she attacked Jessica and used her ring to summon the Anti-Monitor to fight her father.  Thinking of ways to stop the fighting between the Anti-Monitor and Darkseid, Jessica helped Mister Miracle break out the Crime Syndicate in order to fight the rampaging monsters. The ring being in close proximity to the Syndicate however overwhelmed Jessica, and the being inside the ring possessed her body and mind.  When Grail summoned the Black Racer, the New God of Death, to kill the Flash, Jessica maintained enough control of her body to jump in the path of the Black Racer and seemingly kill herself to save the Flash. The Black Racer though, managed to kill the entity in her ring controlling her, causing her Power Ring to crumble apart on her finger. For her ability to overcome fear, Jessica was then tracked down and bestowed a Green Lantern Ring, becoming Earth\'s newest Green Lantern. '),

Despite these hardships, Simon managed to graduate high school, and proceeded into higher education, gaining a degree in engineering, followed by a job in an automotive plant. However, when the financial crisis hit, Simon was fired from his job.  In desperation to make money, Simon took up illegal street-racing, something he proved good at. Eventually, though, disaster struck during one race, and his brother in-law was severely injured and placed into a coma. Simon just barely escaped being arrested and sent to prison for that. As a result of his guilt, Simon grew increasingly distant from his sister.  Some time later, still financially desperate, Simon began stealing cars, to re-sell them for parts. One night, while stealing a van, Simon accidentally stole a van filled with explosives. A high-speed chase ensued, ending with Simon\'s arrest. As a result of his heritage, Simon was immediately suspected to be a terrorist and deported to Guantanamo Bay for further questioning. Despite the efforts of the more reasonable Agent Fed, Simon\'s attempt to claim he was innocent was ignored, and he was nearly subject to torture.  At that moment, a Green Lantern Ring burst into the room, and despite being badly defective found Simon a suitable candidate, removing him from the holding facility. [1]  The ring transported Simon to Florida, and while he remained unconscious, mapped his neural pathways. When Simon awoke, the ring displayed a message from its previous owners, Hal Jordan and Sinestro, telling him not to go to Oa, and not to trust anyone. Ignoring their message, Simon made his way to Detroit and contacted his sister. Angered by his former distance, she told him to meet him at a safer location. As he waited, Simon altered his ring-generated outfit to hide his identity better. Unfortunately, the quiet wait was interrupted by the arrival of the Justice League. [2] '),

His behavior so shamed his father Robert that he was relegated to clerical work on an oil rig in the Pacific. Naturally, Oliver turned the rig into a hub for his parties. At one such party, a helicopter meant to be carrying a famous rock star was commandeered by oil-thieving terrorists, who soon took over the rig.  Against the warnings of his friend Tommy Merlyn, Oliver recklessly faced the terrorist leader armed with only a bow and arrow, courtesy of his father\'s to this point fruitless training. The terrorists were armed with a detonator to a battery of explosives, including some which they had strapped to Oliver\'s girlfriend Leena. Oliver managed to shoot the detonator out of the terrorist\'s hand, but it bounced and activated, blowing up half the rig, and killing Leena. Fortunately for Oliver, his life was saved by Tommy - but his friend had taken the brunt of the blast, and was very badly burnt. After this, Oliver washed up on the shore of a deserted island, and was forced to survive with only his bow and arrow for a year.[1] Zero Year  During the Zero Year, Oliver came back from the island and learned about the Gotham blackout, and the fact that his mother Moira Queen went there to help.

He often got into trouble with the police but, because it usually happened on the reservation, Big Bow was always able to get him out of trouble.

That night, the Joker took her to the Ace Chemical Processing Plant where his persona had been born, and promised that this would be her birthday. Realizing his intention, she had struggled, but he shoved her into one of the chemical vats and watched her sink to the bottom. Afterwards, he drained it and found her inside, alive, but changed. She had lost touch with reality, which meant that she could do whatever she liked. He dubbed her Harley Quinn, and the two of them were together - until he tired of her.[5]\r\n\r\nFreed of the constraints and strict regiment of her former life, Harley chose a uniform for herself, forming a mosaic of all of the people she was or wanted to be. Any guilt for the crimes she committed as Harley Quinn was repressed along with Harleen Quinzel.[6] ');

Because he was treated like a monster for most of his life, he became very cynical and dangerous, making him an enemy of Batman. However, he\'s made multiple attempts to show his kinder side when given the opportunity.\r\nOrigin\r\n\r\nWaylon Jones was raised by his Auntie Flowers in Gotham City before becoming the monster he would grow up to be one day. Cursed with an incurable birth defect that made him gradually become more reptilian in appearance, Jones was ridiculed as a child.\r\n\r\nAs he grew into a young adult, Jones seemed to embrace what he had become. Becoming a professional carnival wrestler, the man adopted the name \"Killer Croc\". However, tired of people treating him like a monster because he looked different, Croc became bitter with the world and began to turn to violence, such as biting off his wrestling manager\'s hand when the man verbally abused him. [1]\r\nEarly Career\r\n\r\nCroc later as an adult took to the sewers of Gotham, finding it an appropriate place for him to live. His shadowy nature and monstrous appearance made him appear as a threat to the city\'s protector Batman, and the two battled each other a few times.\r\n\r\nDuring Batman\'s second year as a vigilante, Croc participated in the \"War of Jokes and Riddles\" between the Joker and the Riddler for the right to kill Batman. Jones volunteered for the Riddler\'s army and, alongside multiple other of Gotham\'s worst, fought for weeks with the Bat unable to control the violence. Eventually, Batman was forced to work alongside the Riddler in order to stop the Joker and, when the clown was finally cornered, double-crossed Croc and the rest of Nygma\'s army by simultaneously incapacitating all of them with Kiteman\'s kites.[2]\r\n\r\nAt a point when Croc wasn\'t in Arkham, he fought Roy Harper in Hell\'s Kitchen but quickly noticed Roy wasn\'t fighting back. He figured out that Roy was trying to have him commit assisted suicide and comforted the ex-sidekick instead of fighting him. [3] Croc actually became Roy\'s sponsor for his alcoholism.[4] ');
